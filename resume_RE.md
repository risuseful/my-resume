### Reservoir Engineer at Carigali Hess Operating Company Sdn Bhd in Malaysia.

**Jan 2017 to current**	
  
- Main responsibilities include reviewing reservoir modeling studies, preparing scope of work, updating existing reservoir models, reviewing, and analyzing reservoir and production engineering data (fluid properties, SCAL, PLT, etc.), mentoring junior reservoir engineers, collaborate with other departments on projects execution, preparing short and long-term business plans, meeting and presenting reservoir modeling and reservoir engineering studies to shareholders.

**Specific tasks:**
- Responsible for dynamic modelling of the Bumi Shallow reservoir situated in the South China Sea. This reservoir features stacked zones, necessitating the implementation of commingled perforations. My responsibilities include addressing challenges related to water and sand production. Additionally, managing a depleted reservoir poses challenges in identifying new infill opportunities. Main duties include:
  - Update history matched models; including SCAL.
  - Perform a proper transition from history matching to forecast.
  - Setting the development plans strategies and constraints including the downtime, wells growth, and reservoir pressure limits.
  - Constructing NFA (no further action) and selecting all development concepts through an integrated study that incorporate surface and subsurface input.  
  - Implemented advanced method in infill locations optimizations using the Python programming language.
  - Performing a comparison between analytical and simulation performance by reservoir for each of the infill wells to narrow down the uncertainty and risk.
  - Optimizing simulation run time, initializing the simulation model, and performing volumetric comparison between static and dynamic models.
  - Work with production engineers to ensure vertical lift performance cover realistic range of pressures, rates, and water gas ratio.
- Conduct long-term gas production forecast for yearly Work Program and Budget.  Main duties are:
  - Coupled standalone reservoir models from all reservoir engineers with the pipeline network, i.e., reservoir coupling.
  - Conduct history matching of pressure loss of pipelines using PIPESIM.
  - Work with well services to ensure that implemented development plans as per the scheduled workovers and drilling activities.
  - Prepared well-by-well sales and gross gas production rates according to the format specified by the corporate planning and finance departments.
- Conduct long-term gas production for Area Development Planning of fields to sustain production beyond production sharing contract (PSC).  Main tasks included are:
  - Wrote a simulator from scratch to auto-generate well-startup schedule (WSU) based on decline curve analysis and type-curve concept.  This work was published at a SPE conference.
  - Ensure consistency of the simulation input: maximum well rates, plateau rate, decline rate, sales gas nomination, shrinkage, etc.
  - Report potential CO2 production and collaborate with process engineers so that available booster compressors can handle the CO2 concentration.
- Advanced initiatives to support other engineers/geoscientists within the organization:
  - Developed artificial intelligence-based computer programs for well surveillance using Python and SQL.
  - Generate well-by-well forecast (using artificial intelligence) of gas rate production and water production.
  - Developed a sequence stratigraphy simulator for seismic inversion using Python.  The simulator allows a geophysicist to control the geological-time sea level changes and sand rate deposition, which helps in understanding how the sand developed throughout time.
  - Participated in APGCE GEOHack competition, applications of artificial intelligence in well log interpretation.

### Assistant Professor (Petroleum Engineering) at Heriot-Watt University in Malaysia.
