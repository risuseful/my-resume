## Professional Experience
### Carigali Hess Operating Company Sdn Bhd, Malaysia. 
**Reservoir Engineer**, Jan 2020 - Present  
- Perform well location optimization for Bumi Shallow using tNavigator and Python.  Creaming curve was generated for 1000s of wells on a depleted brown field to seek hard-to-identify undrained areas/sequences.
- Recommends well works to production engineers and well services; isolating water producing zones based on latest RST/PLT tests, sand cleanout, lifting of liquid holdups with CTU / foam sticks.
- Developed analytics-based computer programs for gas well surveillance objectives.  The app was built using Python and streamlit library, with the machine learning model running in the backend in the form of a joblib file.  Users can adjust any well choke size and quickly get the total production rate of the entire facility using machine learning.
- Developed and history matched tNavigator reservoir coupling model consisting multiple gas reservoirs.  Coupling several gas reservoir standalone models was done by setting up the relevant group keywords (GRUPNET, GRUPTREE, GRUPMAST).  After coupling, all pressure lost across every pipeline must be history matched using PIPESIM (by adjusting several pipeline parameters).  All updated drilling and well intervention schedules were incorporated in the coupled model to ensure reliable long term gas production forecast.
- Written deep learning-based Python code (LSTM) for HSE analytics.  Here, the developed machine learning (recurrent neural network, type LSTM) program is able to classify every offshore HSE report with 70% accuracy.
- Coordinator for training for subsurface employees and technical papers subscription.  
- Experienced in computer programming languages such as SQL, R, Python, and VBA among other tools used in day-to-day tasks.
- Developed a molecular simulator from scratch using R programming langugage for drilling fluid formulation purposes (this work was published).  The simulator models the adsorption process of surfactants on clays, to see the effect of adsorption in preventing clays from flocculating.  3 different molecules were simulated, and the simulated adsorption rate were observed.  Random Walk Monte Carlo approach was used to develop the simulator.
- Developed a sequence stratigraphy simulator for seismic inversion using Python, using concepts from decline curve analysis.  The simulator allows a geophysicist to control the geological-time sea level changes and sand rate deposition, which helps in understanding how the sand developed throughout time.
- Customize a Python-based Lattice Boltzmann code to simulate fluid flow across membrane; a research collaboration with University of Putra Malaysia.
- Present a weekly summary of daily drilling meetings to management.
- Serve as external examiner for Petroleum Engineering department at UCSI University.  

### Carigali Hess Operating Company Sdn Bhd, Malaysia. 
**Senior Planner**, Jan 2017 – Dec 2019  
- Conducted reservoir simulations and compiled gas production forecasts for work program & budget for corporate planning and finance department.  
- Developed tool to generate gas production forecasts and drilling schedule .  A simulator, called Field Planner was developed using the concept of type curves, i.e., rate vs cumulatives.  This simulator can simulate 20 years production forecasts in less than 10 seconds, and the results were comparable with a commercial simulator (ECLIPSE). This work was published, and cited by the latest book of the Society of Petroleum Engineers; Sankaran et al,  "Data Analytics in Reservoir Engineering")
- Provided long term gas production forecasts for Area Development Planning of West Flank to increase future gas production capacity beyond PSC using analytical approach (with Field Planner simulator, which I’ve developed in-house), with EUR and DCA-based rates as input data.
- Developed and maintained an in-house operations management simulator for daily production strategy.  Using Visual Basic, I have developed an optimization-based app that allows offshore to quickly allocate production rates for each well/platform based on buyer’s gas nomination.  This simulator was deployed at the offshore control room.
- Developed analytics-based computer programs for gas well surveillance objectives (this work was published).  Collaborating with IT, I’ve developed the machine learning backend program using the R programming language to compute the water gas ratio for each well.  Furthermore, I’ve also developed a machine learning program to rank the wells to identify the water producing wells. Genetic Algorithm optimization algorithm was used to solve for the water gas ratio of each well.  This program was very beneficial for the overall reservoir management strategy.
- Participated in APGCE GEOhack competition; applications of data science in well log interpretation.  Here, we’ve developed an R program to do classification based on the given well logs.
- Developed a data science program for seismic interpretation. By collaborating with a geophysicist, I’ve developed a neural network-based program (using R) to perform supervised learning on seismic attributes.

### Heriot-Watt University, Malaysia. 
**Assistant Professor**, Aug 2016 - Dec 2016
- Taught engineering mathematics and reservoir engineering.
- Involved in document preparations for university accreditation.

### Carigali Hess Operating Company Sdn Bhd, Malaysia. 
**Reservoir Engineer**, Nov 2014 – Jul 2016  
- Developed VBA-based computer programs for uncertainty of long-term gas production capacity. One of the programs that I’ve developed was to simulate well-by-well production rates with unplanned shutdowns.  The unplanned shutdowns were simulated based on historical data and Monte Carlo algorithm.  
- Developed other VBA-based computer programs to automate reporting of gas production forecasts.
- Conducted petroleum economics analysis on desander projects.
- Assessed assisted history matching / production optimization software.  I was responsible to assess the capability of MEPO as an uncertainty analysis tool for the company’s reservoir coupled model.  It was useful to understand the distribution of the plateau length in our gas production forecasts.

### Schlumberger, Malaysia. 
**Reservoir Engineer**, Jan 2012 – Aug 2014  
- Conducted training and support on reservoir simulation tools for major oil/gas clients (Petronas, ExxonMobil, Vestigo, Hess, New Fields).  Here, I’ve taught several courses to reservoir engineers: Petrel Reservoir Engineering, Petrel Assisted History Matching, Petrel Well Design, ECLIPSE, MEPO Assisted History Matching and Production Optimization under uncertainty.  I’ve also developed novel history matching and production optimization solutions to clients using the Petrel Workflow Editor.  One of the Petrel Workflow I’ve developed was used to automatically come up with a creaming curve (Hess).  Another Petrel Workflow I’ve developed was used to optimize new well locations.
- Worked closely with sales team in strategic account development and product delivery for business growth.
- Worked extensively to develop new AI-based technology (this work was published).  To elaborate more, the company’s strategic direction was to apply machine learning algorithms on well testing.  Using R and Random Forests algorithm, I’ve developed a machine learning-based framework that rank the wells based on their impact to the overall reservoir behaviour.  The results were published on OnePetro, and it was cited by a well-known data science paper in OnePetro.
- Successfully completed 3+ months of intensive training in Field Development Planning (FDP), reservoir simulation (black oil, compositional, dual porosity), well test analysis, PVT matching, PIPESIM, MEPO (history matching), and Intersect simulator, at various training locations; Abu Dhabi (UAE), Houston (USA), and Abingdon (UK).
